What are graphs?
Graphs: vectors and edges (objects and relationships)

Example 1 Social Networking
What types of objects and relationships does a tweet have? 
tweets consist of many of the same elements and relationships as the Facebook posts. 
Tweets have users, they contain text, tweets can point to one another or to URL's, they have hashtags, they can include reference to various other types of media, but what about relationships? 

much like Facebook, relationships and tweets are more reflective of what the users do with tweets. For example, people create tweets, they respond to tweets, they mention other users, and so forth.  

Use cases: 
Biological networks- relations between gene information and literature co-relations
Human information network analytics- co relating linkedin with social networks with cv's etc
smart cities- graphs the movement of traffic around the city including volume of movement(people getting on and off) and not restricted to traffic, water, wifi, padestrians, etc

Big data V's on graphs - volume, velocity, variety, valence (more valence = more nodes connected)

Variety- data can come from a relational db, xml/json,graph-structured, document
Variety- social networks, citation networks, interaction networks, semantic web/linked data, ontologies (in there one must capture what it means to be an edge)
Valence - interconnected-ness = stronger connections, increases over time
-Modeling the effect of valence
-Managing the effect of valence
