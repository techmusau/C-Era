Graph analytics - using the mathematical properties of data to come up with a solution
Analytics- path analytics, connectivity analytics, community analytics, centrality analytics
Tweets are complex nodes, they have labels or types within it, eg, user hashtag, etc
Nodes and edges consist of properties defined by the node schema or edge schema, they consist of id, attribute and value areas

When turning data into a graph first thing you should do is identify the information model ie:
Set of verticies
set of edges
set of node types
type assignment to nodes
a set of edge types
type assignment to edges
set of node attributes
set of edge attributes

"Weight" and edge property: why weights?; helps indicate 'distance' or, 'strength of connection' or, 'likelyhood of interaction' or, 'certainty of information'

Loops: structural property of data where the edge loops back to its node
multigraphs: where a node can have multiple types of interaction with another node

Path Analytics:
Paths are walks of a graph where a node can be visited only once, it does not repeat any edges
cycle- a path of length greater than or equal to 3 whos start and end vertices are the same
acyclic - a graph with no cycles
Trail - a walk with no repeating edges
reachability - node U is reachable from node V, their is a path from node U to V but not necessarily a path from V to U
Infinite nodes or termination nodes have no edges out or no edges in

Path Optimization:
Depends on the needs of the function
Paths could have inclusive nodes or exclusive nodes
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest from a single node to all other nodes
Dijkstra's algorithm: the next node picked to include in the path has the lowest cost add from the current node
Dijkstra's algorithm is very expensive to execute for large graphs, that is with high computational complexity (Performance of an algorithm is measured by the size of the data)

Inclusion and Exclusuin constraints
Creating constraints and sub graphs that can solved simultaneously to reduce complexity and time
Constraints like- no repeating nodes or trail, cyclic walks, acyclic walks
Diameter of a graph - the maximum number of steps or hops to go to the most distant node in the graph
(Graphs are a diagram of a mathematical function and charts are graphical representations of data)
