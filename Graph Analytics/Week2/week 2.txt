Graph analytics - using the mathematical properties of data to come up with a solution
Analytics- path analytics, connectivity analytics, community analytics, centrality analytics
Tweets are complex nodes, they have labels or types within it, eg, user hashtag, etc
Nodes and edges consist of properties defined by the node schema or edge schema, they consist of id, attribute and value areas

When turning data into a graph first thing you should do is identify the information model ie:
Set of verticies
set of edges
set of node types
type assignment to nodes
a set of edge types
type assignment to edges
set of node attributes
set of edge attributes

"Weight" and edge property: why weights?; helps indicate 'distance' or, 'strength of connection' or, 'likelyhood of interaction' or, 'certainty of information'

Loops: structural property of data where the edge loops back to its node
multigraphs: where a node can have multiple types of interaction with another node

Path Analytics:
Paths are walks of a graph where a node can be visited only once, it does not repeat any edges
cycle- a path of length greater than or equal to 3 whos start and end vertices are the same
acyclic - a graph with no cycles
Trail - a walk with no repeating edges
reachability - node U is reachable from node V, their is a path from node U to V but not necessarily a path from V to U
Ifinite nodes or termination nodes have no edges out or no edges in
